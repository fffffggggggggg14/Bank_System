The "Banking System using C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)" project is a simulation of a banking system developed using C++ programming language following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project aims to simulate basic banking operations such as opening accounts, performing transfers, withdrawals, deposits, and viewing account details. It demonstrates how to organize data using classes, attributes, and methods, with each part of the system being separated into independent objects to enhance maintainability and flexibility.

Key Features of the Project:

Account Management: Allows the user to open new accounts with properties such as name, account number, and account balance.
Deposits and Withdrawals: Users can perform deposit and withdrawal operations on their account using an interactive interface.
Financial Transfers: Allows the user to perform financial transfers between different accounts in the system.
Account Details View: Provides the ability to view the account balance and transaction history.
Transaction Management: Stores financial transactions and automatically updates the accounts.
User Interface: Interact with the system through a console-based interface that allows easy interaction with banking services.
Technologies Used:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Classes: Each operation or component in the system is represented as an independent class. For example, thereâ€™s an Account class to represent bank accounts and a Transaction class to represent financial transactions.
Objects: Each bank account or transaction is represented as an object of a particular class.
Inheritance: Base classes can be extended to create specialized classes when necessary (e.g., SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount classes can inherit from the same base class).
Encapsulation: Hides the system's implementation details from the user, allowing access to data through secure interfaces.
Polymorphism: Allows the program to create common interfaces and methods across multiple classes.
Programming Language: C++

Storage: Account data and transactions are stored in text files (can be expanded to use databases in the future).

Example Classes:

Account Class:
Attributes: Account number, name, balance.
Methods: Deposit, withdraw, view balance.
Transaction Class:
Attributes: Transaction type (deposit, withdrawal), amount, date.
Methods: Execute transaction, view transaction details.
Bank Class:
Attributes: List of accounts, list of transactions.
Methods: Add new account, perform transfers, complete transactions.
Project Goal:

Learning and Application: Learn how to design and build a complex system using Object-Oriented Programming principles and apply them to a real-world project.
Enhance C++ Skills: Apply concepts like objects, inheritance, and polymorphism using C++.
Build a Flexible and Maintainable System: Use OOP techniques to structure the code and make the system easy to extend and maintain.
